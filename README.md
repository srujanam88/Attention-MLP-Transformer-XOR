# How-Transformers-Implement-XOR-A-Mechanistic-Perspective
This research work focuses on observing the phenomenon of grokking in simple transformer architectures when trained on dataset of XOR and parity logic. The trained models are then reverse engineered to understand the hidden transformer learnings and patterns.
